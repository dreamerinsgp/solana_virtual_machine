Q1： what is a priority graph?
A Priority Graph is a data structure that:
1) Stores transactions with their account access information
2) Tracks conflicts between transactions based on shared accounts
3) Maintains priority ordering (highest priority transactions first)
4) Manages blocking relationships (when transactions block each other)


Q2: Data structure 

type SchedulePrioGraph = PrioGraph<
    TransactionPriorityId, //Node: Transaction ID with priority 
    Pubkey,            //Edge: Account(resource) that connects transactions
    TransactionPriorityId,  //Value stored in graph 
    PriorityFunction     //Function to determine priority
>;

Think of it as:
Nodes = Transactions (with priority)
Edges = Account conflicts (transactions sharing accounts)
Graph = Relationships showing which transactions conflict


Q3: How conflicts between transactions are maintained in a priority graph ?
