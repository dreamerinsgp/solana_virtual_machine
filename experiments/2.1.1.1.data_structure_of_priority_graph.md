Q1: list the data structure of priority graph.

The priority graph is a generic graph structure with 4 type parameters:

```rust
type SchedulerPrioGraph = PrioGraph<
    TransactionPriorityId,  // Node: Transaction ID with priority
    Pubkey,                  // Edge: Account (resource) connecting transactions
    TransactionPriorityId,  // Value: Stored in graph nodes
    PriorityFunction         // Function: Determines priority ordering
>;
```

**Simple breakdown:**
- **Nodes** = Transactions (identified by `TransactionPriorityId`)
- **Edges** = Accounts (`Pubkey`) that create conflicts between transactions
- **Graph** = Tracks which transactions conflict on which accounts

**In the scheduler:**
```rust
struct PrioGraphScheduler {
    prio_graph: SchedulerPrioGraph,  // The priority graph instance
    // ... other fields
}
```


Q2: How transaction is inserted in the graph?

Transactions are inserted using `insert_transaction()`:

```rust
prio_graph.insert_transaction(
    *id,  // TransactionPriorityId
    Self::get_transaction_account_access(transaction),  // Iterator of (Pubkey, AccessKind)
);
```

**Steps:**
1. Get transaction ID (with priority)
2. Extract account access info (which accounts the transaction reads/writes)
3. Call `insert_transaction()` - graph automatically creates edges to conflicting transactions

**Code location**: `prio_graph_scheduler.rs:198-201`

**When**: During look-ahead window phase, transactions are popped from container and inserted into graph


Q3: How transaction is popped out of the graph?

Transactions are popped using `pop()`:

```rust
while let Some(id) = self.prio_graph.pop() {
    // Transaction is popped and attempted to schedule
    unblock_this_batch.push(id);
    // ... try to schedule ...
}
```

**Steps:**
1. Call `prio_graph.pop()` - returns highest priority transaction
2. Transaction is removed from graph
3. Attempt to schedule the transaction
4. After scheduling, call `unblock()` to unblock dependent transactions

**Code location**: `prio_graph_scheduler.rs:244`

**Order**: Transactions are popped in **priority order** (highest priority first)
