The AccountsDB is the persistent state layer where all account data lives. Account state is loaded in before execution, leveraging caches to avoid repeated disk reads for frequently accessed accounts. After successful execution, updates are committed back to AccountsDB. If execution fails, all state changes are reverted atomically.
