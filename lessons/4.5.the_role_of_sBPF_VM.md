The sBPF VM is the sandboxed execution environment where program bytecode actually runs. It is derived from Linux’s eBPF and uses a register-based architecture with 11 general-purpose registers. The VM enforces memory isolation through five distinct memory regions, each with explicit bounds and permissions. The VM also meters compute unit consumption to prevent runaway execution and dispatches system calls for privileged operations such as cryptography, logging, or Cross-Program Invocations (CPIs).
