Q1: what it is ? 
Because the runtime knows exactly which accounts each transaction will access before execution, fees can be localized to specific accounts rather than competing globally across the entire network. This is a concept known as local fee markets. 

On Ethereum, and other EVM chains, every transaction competes in a single global fee market—sending ETH to a friend, minting an NFT, or trading on Uniswap all bid against each other for the same blockspace. A surge in one domain drives up fees for everyone, regardless of whether they are trying to do something completely different. 

On Solana, only transactions that access the same accounts compete with each other. A user transferring SOL between two accounts shouldn’t have to worry about a popular NFT mint happening simultaneously. A transaction’s priority fee is determined solely by account contention. This localization is why Solana transactions can remain inexpensive, even during periods of high activity.

For instance, on October 10th, the crypto market experienced its largest-ever liquidation event. Despite the record-breaking surge in activity, Solana transactions remained relatively inexpensive, with the median transaction fee hitting $0.007, average fees briefly hitting $0.10, and the top 1% of transactions peaking at just above $1.00. In that same timeframe, both Ethereum and Arbitrum had their median fees spike above $100, while Base’s fees peaked at over $3.

Q2: what makes it good compared to global fee markets ?
