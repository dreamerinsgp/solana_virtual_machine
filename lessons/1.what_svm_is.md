Q1: what svm is ?

**Answer:**

The Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) is one of the most misunderstood systems in blockchains today. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which refers unambiguously to an opcode executor, the term SVM encompasses an entire transaction execution pipeline, from the Banking Stage scheduler to the sBPF bytecode interpreter itself.

There are two main perspectives on what the SVM is:

**Narrow View:**
The SVM is treated as analogous to a traditional virtual machine (VM), such as the EVM's opcode executor. More specifically, it refers to the eBPF-derived virtual machine (rBPF, now sBPF) that interprets and JIT-compiles bytecode. This perspective emphasizes the SVM as a sandboxed, register-based executor that handles instructions, such as ALU operations or Solana-specific system calls. Essentially, the SVM is inspired by Linux eBPF's safety model, but is customized for blockchain infrastructure.

**Broad View:**
The SVM is defined as the entire transaction execution layer of a Solana validator. This includes more than just running bytecode; it also encompasses upstream components, such as the Banking Stage's scheduler, compute unit budgeting, and state updates via the accounts database (AccountsDB). It's the "runtime" that turns raw transactions into validated state changes.

**Anza's Official Definition:**
Anza has formalized the SVM specification, defining it as "the components responsible for transaction execution," packaged as a stand-alone library for validators, fraud proofs, sidecars, and more.

**Formal Definition:**
The Solana Virtual Machine can be defined as:

*The decoupled runtime interface and transaction processing pipeline within Solana validators, driven by the Bank component, that orchestrates parallel instruction and on-chain program execution, provisioning a customized eBPF-based virtual machine for secure bytecode interpretation, JIT compilation, and resource metering.*

This definition reflects the broader, pipeline-inclusive view that encompasses the complete execution stack, not just the bytecode interpreter itself.
