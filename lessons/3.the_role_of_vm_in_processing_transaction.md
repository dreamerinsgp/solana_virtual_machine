When a transaction is submitted to a blockchain, the VM is responsible for:

Loading the necessary account data from storage.
Executing the program bytecode specified in the transaction.
Metering resource consumption to prevent infinite loops or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
Validating that all state changes follow the network’s predefined consensus rules.
Committing the updated state back to permanent storage (i.e., the ledger).
