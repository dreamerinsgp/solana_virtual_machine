The term “Solana Virtual Machine” (SVM) has sparked contentious debate within the community, especially since the emergence of network extensions and other layer blockchains being built on top of Solana. Contention stems from the term’s scope: Is the SVM strictly the low-level sBPF interpreter, or does it encompass the full transaction execution stack? 

The narrow view treats the SVM as analogous to a traditional virtual machine (VM), such as the EVM’s opcode executor. More specifically, the eBPF-derived virtual machine (rBPF, now sBPF) that interprets and JIT-compiles bytecode. This perspective emphasizes the SVM as a sandboxed, register-based executor that handles instructions, such as ALU operations or Solana-specific system calls. Essentially, the SVM is inspired by Linux eBPF’s safety model, but is customized for blockchain infrastructure. This aligns with phrases like the SVM ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) in validator code, where the SVM is the VM layer alone.

The broad view defines the SVM as the entire transaction execution layer of a Solana validator. This includes more than just running bytecode; it also encompasses upstream components, such as the Banking Stage’s scheduler, compute unit budgeting, and state updates via the accounts database, colloquially known as AccountsDB. It’s the “runtime” that turns raw transactions into validated state changes.

The ambiguity arises because official Solana communications use the term “runtime” interchangeably with “SVM,” without a singular pinned definition. Anza has added much-needed clarity to the debate, explicitly validating it while promoting a pragmatic, action-oriented perspective grounded in engineering. Their framing of the SVM as the Bank-driven runtime that provisions the eBPF VM offers a much broader, pipeline-inclusive view that can be used to form a proper definition of the SVM.

This is formalized in Anza’s official SVM specification, which defines the SVM as “the components responsible for transaction execution,” packaged as a stand-alone library for validators, fraud proofs, sidecars, and more.

For our purposes, we can define the Solana Virtual Machine as:

The decoupled runtime interface and transaction processing pipeline within Solana validators, driven by the Bank component, that orchestrates parallel instruction and on-chain program execution, provisioning a customized eBPF-based virtual machine for secure bytecode interpretation, JIT compilation, and resource metering.
